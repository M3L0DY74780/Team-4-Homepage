<h1 align="center">The Importance of Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication</h1>

<h2>What is a password and why is it necessary to protect your personal data?</h2>
<p style="background-color: gray; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
  Passwords are a secret word, phrase, or character that you create to prove who you are
  so you can access your accounts. They protect your personal information and online accounts 
  from being accessed by others. Without a password, anyone could access your messages, photos, 
  bank accounts, or personal files.
</p>

<h2>The importance of creating strong passwords</h2>
<p style="background-color: gray; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
  A strong password acts as the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your personal
  and professional accounts. With cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated, choosing a password 
  that is easy to remember yet hard for others to guess is crucial. A strong password is
  characterized by its length, complexity, and uniqueness. Ideally, this complexity makes it exponentially 
  harder for attackers to crack through brute force attacks.

  However, the strength of a password is not solely determined by its complexity. Uniqueness is 
  equally important. Reusing passwords across multiple accounts is a common practice, yet it poses
  a significant risk. If one account is compromised, all other accounts using the same password are 
  at risk. Therefore, creating a unique, strong password for each account is imperative. There are 
  also some passwords manager tools you can install and use to store all your different passwords If
  you are afraid of losing them.

  <div>
    <h2>What is a strong password?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>At least 12 characters long.</li>
      <li>Include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols.</li>
      <li>Create new 
passwords for different accounts (do not reuse passwords).</li>
      <li>Use a password manager.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Some examples of password manager tools:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>LastPass</li>
      <li>Bitwarden</li>
      <li>1Password</li>
      <li>Dashlane</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Why Multi-factor authentication?</h2>
<p style="background-color: gray; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
  With the rise of sophisticated hacking techniques, passwords alone can no longer protect against unauthorized
  access and security attacks. That was true even before the pandemic, when the user access-related security threats
  had grown commonplace. In the new normal, the number of successful attacks is staggering.

<h3>Factors used in Multi-Factor Authentication:</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Something You Know</strong></dt>
  <dd>A password, PIN, or answer to a security question.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Something You Have</strong></dt>
  <dd>A device like a phone or hardware token that receives a one-time code.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Something You Are</strong></dt>
  <dd>Biometric data such as a fingerprint, facial recognition, or retina scan.</dd>
</dl>

    <h2>Forms of Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>SMS code or Email OTP – a one-time code sent to your phone or email.</li>
      <li>Authenticator apps – apps that generate time-based codes (e.g. Google Authenticator).</li>
      <li>Smartphone push notification – like “Approve sign-in?” prompts.</li>
    </ol>
