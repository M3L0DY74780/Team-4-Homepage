<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Type of Scam</th>
<th>Solution</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Too good to be true" discounts or offers</td>
<td>Visit the official website or social media account of the company offering the discount. Tis can help you find out if the discount is trustable or it is a scam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>An unknown person asks for your help and wants money or your personal information</td>
<td>Be cautious with money appeals and only give what you're willing to lose if the story canâ€™t be verified. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Receive a message stating that there is suspicious activity on you device</td>
<td>Check where the message originated from. If it is from the phone company you purchased from, you will be able to further contact them. If not, it could be a scam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wanting you to click on a suspicious link to make a payment</td>
<td>Do not click the link. Clicking the link can cause your phone to get a virus which the hacker can steal your personal information.</td>
</tr>
